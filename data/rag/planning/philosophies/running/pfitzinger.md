# Training Philosophy: Pfitzinger (Aerobic Development + LT + Marathon Specificity)

## Philosophy ID
pfitzinger

## Applicable Race Types
- Half marathon to Marathon (primary)
- 10K (secondary, via aerobic strength emphasis)

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Intermediate/advanced marathoners
- Athletes who tolerate structured medium-long aerobic work
- Athletes aiming for marathon readiness via aerobic strength + specificity

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Aerobic endurance and durability
- Lactate threshold development
- Marathon-pace economy and fatigue resistance

## Core Principles
- Aerobic strength is built via sustained endurance work (not constant intensity)
- Marathon specificity is layered after durable aerobic base
- Quality is controlled; recovery is protected to preserve consistent training

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 70–85%
- Moderate/steady (aerobic strength): 5–15%
- Threshold: 5–15%
- High intensity (VO2+): 0–5% (optional, athlete-dependent)

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 2
- Medium-long endurance emphasis is treated as “moderate stress” (budget recovery accordingly)
- Maintain at least one true recovery day or very low stress day weekly

## Sequencing Rules
- Do not stack moderate-stress endurance days adjacent to threshold/quality days without recovery buffer
- Marathon-specific work must not expand while weekly load is also increasing sharply
- Protect sleep and recovery during marathon-specific phases

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- High monotony/strain weeks require a recovery week insertion
- Avoid turning steady/aerobic strength days into threshold days
- Avoid adding intensity when fatigue is already elevated

## Gating Rules
Use this philosophy only if:
- Athlete can sustain consistent weekly structure and recover well
- Athlete has adequate durability to tolerate moderate-stress endurance sessions

Avoid / downgrade if:
- Athlete is inconsistent or injury-prone (use durability-first or 80/20 baseline first)
