# Training Philosophy: 5K Speed-Development Emphasis

## Philosophy ID
5k_speed

## Applicable Race Types
- 1500m to 10K (primary), 5K specialization

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Athletes with solid aerobic base seeking speed and economy
- Runners transitioning from endurance-only to faster racing
- Athletes who handle limited high intensity well

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Neuromuscular economy and speed mechanics (non-technical)
- VO2max stimulus (carefully dosed)
- Speed endurance without excessive fatigue

## Core Principles
- Speed is layered on top of durability; it does not replace it
- High intensity is limited, controlled, and separated by recovery
- Easy running preserves the ability to execute quality sessions well

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 70–85%
- Threshold: 5–15%
- VO2/high intensity: 5–10%
- Speed/neuromuscular: 0–5%

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 2
- No consecutive hard days
- High intensity volume must be capped and adjusted based on recovery

## Sequencing Rules
- Avoid stacking speed and VO2 emphasis in adjacent sessions
- Maintain at least one longer aerobic session weekly (if durable)
- Reduce intensity quickly if fatigue increases

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- Avoid turning the week into multiple “race-like” efforts
- Avoid speed emphasis for athletes without stable base
- Avoid adding speed while increasing weekly load aggressively

## Gating Rules
Use only if:
- Athlete has demonstrated consistent base training
- Athlete is not currently injury-prone or in return-to-run phase
