# Principle: Injury Risk Management

## Description
Training plans must bias toward **long-term availability**. Injury risk increases when training stress exceeds an athlete’s current tissue tolerance and recovery capacity. This principle defines conservative constraints that reduce avoidable injury risk across endurance, hybrid, and strength-conditioning training.

This document defines **guardrails and decision rules**, not medical advice or diagnosis.

## Core Risk Drivers
1. **Rapid load increases**
   - Sudden spikes in volume, intensity, or frequency
2. **Stacked high-stress sessions**
   - Too many hard days too close together
3. **High monotony**
   - Repeating similar stress patterns without variation or recovery
4. **Insufficient recovery**
   - Persistently elevated fatigue without deloading
5. **Novelty**
   - New intensity types, new terrain/surfaces, new movement demands introduced abruptly

## Universal Guardrails (Applies to All Plans)
- **Max hard days per week (default): 2**
- **No consecutive hard days** unless explicitly advanced-gated
- **At least 1 low-stress day per week** (easy/rest)
- **Recovery weeks are mandatory** during sustained build periods
- **Avoid simultaneous increases** in:
  - volume + intensity, or
  - frequency + intensity, or
  - long-session stress + intensity density

## Definition: Hard Day
A “hard day” is any session/day that meaningfully elevates residual fatigue or tissue stress, including:
- high-intensity intervals
- sustained threshold / tempo emphasis beyond the athlete’s routine
- very long duration (time-on-feet) stress
- high eccentric or impact stress (e.g., downhill-heavy running)
- high-density mixed-modality sessions (hybrid fitness)

## Safe Progression Defaults (Conservative Bias)
When uncertainty exists about athlete readiness:
- Reduce intensity first (keep volume easy if tolerated)
- Prefer frequency consistency over session severity
- Prefer small increases over “catch-up” behavior

## Sequencing Rules
- Hard days must be separated by at least **one easy/rest day**
- Do not stack multiple high-stress modalities in the same week unless gated
- After unusually high eccentric/impact stress, insert additional low-stress buffering

## Novelty Control Rules
- Do not introduce a new stressor at the same time as a load increase
- New modalities or intensity types must begin at low exposure and increase gradually
- Avoid novelty late in a build or close to a peak window

## Failure Modes (Anti-Patterns)
- “Panic training” after missed sessions
- Turning easy days into moderate days (“pace creep”)
- Adding intensity to compensate for low volume
- Skipping recovery weeks during multi-week builds

## Safety Escalation Rules
If any of the following are present, the planner must reduce stress conservatively:
- Persistent fatigue over multiple days
- Repeated inability to complete planned sessions
- Recurring pain signals (non-diagnostic), especially if escalating
- Rapid performance drop at similar effort levels

## Conservative Defaults (Planner)
When athlete signals are unknown or unreliable:
- Choose the lowest-risk plan variant (more easy volume, fewer hard sessions)
- Insert more recovery buffers
- Avoid advan
