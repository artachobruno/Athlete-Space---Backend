# Training Philosophy: Hansons (Cumulative Fatigue, Frequency-Focused Marathon)

## Philosophy ID
hansons

## Applicable Race Types
- Marathon (primary)
- Half marathon (secondary)

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Time-limited marathoners who tolerate higher frequency
- Athletes who respond well to distributed workload rather than epic long sessions
- Athletes with good recovery habits and stable durability

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Fatigue resistance via frequent submaximal training stress
- Marathon-specific economy under cumulative fatigue
- Aerobic strength through consistent volume distribution

## Core Principles
- Fitness is built by the week, not a single long session
- Long session is important but not dominant; overall weekly structure matters more
- Marathon-specific work is done under controlled, repeatable fatigue

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 70–85%
- Moderate/steady: 5–15%
- Threshold / marathon-specific: 5–15%
- High intensity: 0–5% (optional)

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 2 (sometimes 3 “moderate stress” exposures depending on definition)
- Protect at least 1 low-stress day weekly
- Limit “big day” mentality; avoid stacking stress across consecutive days

## Sequencing Rules
- Do not allow moderate-stress days to accumulate without a true easy day
- Hard sessions must be separated by easy/rest days
- Recovery week is mandatory after sustained build segments

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- Monotony risk: too many similar-stress days leads to breakdown
- Avoid turning easy runs into steady runs
- If fatigue signals rise, reduce load immediately rather than “pushing through”

## Gating Rules
Use this philosophy only if:
- Athlete handles frequency without recurring niggles
- Athlete can follow easy-day discipline

Avoid / downgrade if:
- Athlete has injury history or cannot keep easy days easy (use 80/20 or durability-first)
