# Principle: Tapering

## Description
A taper is a planned reduction in training load to reduce accumulated fatigue while maintaining key fitness. The goal is to arrive at an event (or a peak-performance window) with high readiness and low residual fatigue, without losing sport-specific sharpness.

This document defines tapering as **constraints and decision rules**, not a prescription of workouts.

## When Tapering Applies
Tapering is appropriate when:
- Preparing for a target performance date (race, test, or planned peak week)
- Exiting a high-load training block to restore readiness
- Managing elevated fatigue signals while preserving continuity

Tapering is not required when:
- No end-goal objective exists (use "maintenance mode" instead)
- The athlete is already under-recovered and inconsistent (prioritize recovery and consistency first)

## Core Principles
1. Reduce fatigue by reducing total load
2. Maintain some intensity exposure to preserve neuromuscular and metabolic sharpness
3. Avoid introducing novel stressors (new intensity types, new modalities, new skills demands)
4. Preserve routine: keep frequency similar when possible to maintain rhythm

## Load Reduction Strategy
Tapering changes training by adjusting three levers:
- Volume (primary lever)
- Intensity exposure (maintain in small amounts)
- Frequency (secondary lever; reduce only if needed for recovery)

### Accepted Load Reduction Ranges (General)
- Short taper window: modest reduction (readiness focus)
- Medium taper window: moderate reduction (fatigue unloading)
- Long taper window: larger reduction with careful intensity maintenance

The system should select the smallest reduction that achieves readiness, biased toward:
- Consistency
- Injury risk minimization
- Avoiding abrupt changes that disrupt routine

## Intensity During a Taper
Allowed:
- Small, controlled exposures to higher intensity to maintain sharpness
- Short efforts that do not create large residual fatigue

Not allowed:
- Increasing intensity density (more hard minutes than in prior weeks)
- New high-stress session types introduced during taper
- Stacking hard days close together

## Session Sequencing Rules
- Do not place multiple high-stress sessions back-to-back
- Separate intensity exposures with easy or rest days
- Avoid combining long duration and high intensity late in a taper window

## Sport-Specific Notes (Running)
- Maintain some stride/speed stimulus only if it is already part of the athlete’s routine
- Avoid adding downhill-focused stress late in taper (eccentric load risk)
- Avoid sudden surface or footwear changes during taper

## Common Failure Modes
1. "Panic training"
   - Increasing training load close to peak date due to anxiety
2. "Detraining taper"
   - Cutting too much volume and removing all intensity exposure
3. "Novelty taper"
   - Adding new workouts, strength stimuli, or skills work late in the process
4. "Stacked stress"
   - Clustering intensity efforts close together, causing residual fatigue

## Safety Guardrails
- If recovery signals are poor, bias toward reducing volume first
- If injury risk is elevated, remove intensity before increasing load
- Do not increase both intensity and volume in the taper period
- If uncertainty exists, choose the more conservative taper (less intensity, simpler structure)

## Conservative Defaults
When the system lacks reliable fatigue/recovery information:
- Reduce volume modestly
- Maintain routine frequency if possible
- Include minimal intensity exposure only if it has been consistently present previously
- Prioritize sleep/recovery-friendly scheduling (no late-week overload)

## Decision Checklist (Planner)
Before applying a taper, the planner must determine:
- Is there a target performance window? If not, use maintenance mode.
- What was the recent load trend (stable, rising, spiky)?
- Is the athlete showing signs of excess fatigue?
- What intensity types has the athlete already tolerated?
- What is the minimum reduction needed to restore readiness safely?
