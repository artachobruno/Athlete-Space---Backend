# Training Philosophy: Norwegian-Inspired Controlled Intensity (Advanced-Gated)

## Philosophy ID
norwegian

## Applicable Race Types
- 5K to Marathon (advanced)
- Not a default philosophy; use only when explicitly appropriate

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Advanced, durable athletes with stable training history
- Athletes capable of tight intensity control and recovery discipline
- Athletes with monitoring capability (subjective or objective)

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- High-quality repeatability with controlled metabolic stress
- Threshold development without frequent maximal efforts
- Precision execution to avoid overreaching

## Core Principles
- Controlled intensity is prioritized over maximal intensity
- Session quality is judged by repeatability and low residual fatigue
- Hard work is distributed carefully and buffered by easy training

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 70–85%
- Threshold-controlled: 10–25%
- High intensity: 0–5% (rare, tightly used)

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 2 (sometimes 3 “controlled” exposures depending on strictness)
- Strict separation between stress days
- Recovery weeks are mandatory at defined intervals

## Sequencing Rules
- No back-to-back stress days
- Avoid introducing VO2max emphasis while threshold density is high
- If recovery markers degrade, reduce stress immediately

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- This is not a “more is better” model; it’s a control model
- Avoid adopting without a strong base and recovery capacity
- Avoid using for beginners or athletes without execution discipline

## Gating Rules
Use only if:
- Athlete has months of consistent training without breakdown
- Athlete has demonstrated controlled execution under fatigue

Avoid / downgrade if:
- Any signs of instability, recurrent injuries, or inconsistent training
