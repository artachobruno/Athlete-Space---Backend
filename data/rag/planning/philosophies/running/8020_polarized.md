# Training Philosophy: 80/20 / Polarized Running

## Philosophy ID
8020_polarized

## Applicable Race Types
- 5K to Ultra (with sport-specific adjustments)

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Most athletes, especially:
  - Injury-prone
  - Time-stressed
  - Consistency-focused
  - Masters athletes
- Athletes who tend to overdo moderate intensity

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Aerobic capacity and durability
- Reduced injury risk via controlled intensity
- High consistency over long timelines

## Core Principles
- Majority of volume is low intensity
- High intensity is limited and purposeful
- Moderate intensity is minimized unless specifically required by race demands
- Easy means easy; intensity discipline is non-negotiable

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Low intensity: 75–90%
- Moderate/threshold: 0–15%
- High intensity: 0–10%

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 2
- Hard days separated by at least 1 easy/rest day
- Long run is primarily low intensity (unless specifically gated and tolerated)

## Sequencing Rules
- No stacking of hard efforts
- Avoid “gray zone” drift on easy days
- Recovery weeks inserted proactively

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- Too much moderate intensity is the most common failure mode
- Avoid adding intensity to compensate for missed volume
- Avoid “testing” too frequently (creates hidden intensity load)

## Gating Rules
Default philosophy when:
- Athlete profile is unknown
- Recovery signals are limited
- Safety bias is required
