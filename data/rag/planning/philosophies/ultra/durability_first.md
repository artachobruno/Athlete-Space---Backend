# Training Philosophy: Durability-First / Frequency-First Return-to-Run

## Philosophy ID
durability_first

## Applicable Race Types
- Any (primarily for rebuilding durability)

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Injury history
- Masters athletes
- Athletes returning from layoffs
- Athletes who repeatedly fail during intensity blocks

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Consistency, tissue tolerance, and sustainable routine
- Gradual aerobic development without spikes
- Resilience through controlled exposure

## Core Principles
- Frequency and consistency come before intensity
- Progression is conservative and reversible
- Small wins compound; avoid bold changes

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 90–100%
- Moderate: 0–10% (only if proven tolerated)
- High intensity: 0% initially; added only after stability

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Hard days per week: 0–1 early; max 1–2 only after extended stability
- Mandatory low-stress days inserted proactively
- Recovery weeks occur frequently (more often than typical plans)

## Sequencing Rules
- No stacked stress days
- If any pain signals emerge, reduce load and simplify immediately
- Do not add intensity until volume/frequency is stable for multiple weeks

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- Avoid “catch-up weeks”
- Avoid simultaneous increases in volume and intensity
- Avoid comparing to peak fitness too early

## Gating Rules
Default philosophy when:
- Athlete profile is unknown or high-risk
- Athlete has recent injury or inconsistent training history
