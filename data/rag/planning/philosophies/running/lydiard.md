# Training Philosophy: Lydiard (Aerobic Base → Hills → Sharpening)

## Philosophy ID
lydiard

## Applicable Race Types
- 5K to Marathon (road), general endurance development

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Athletes who can sustain consistent frequency and moderate-to-high volume
- Athletes seeking long-term aerobic development and durability
- Athletes who respond well to clear phases rather than constant intensity

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Deep aerobic development and capillarization (base)
- Strength-endurance and running economy (hills)
- Specific speed and sharpening (late phase)

## Core Principles
- Build aerobic capacity before emphasizing intensity
- Phase separation: avoid premature speed work during base
- Hills serve as a bridge between pure aerobic work and high-intensity speed
- Consistency over months is the main driver of results

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 80–90% during base
- Moderate/steady: 5–15% (as controlled aerobic strength)
- High intensity: 0–5% in base; increases only in sharpening phase

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Base phase: limit hard days to 0–1 (strides allowed if already routine)
- Hill phase: 1–2 “strength” exposures/week (not maximal)
- Sharpening: max hard days 2/week

## Sequencing Rules
- Do not introduce high-intensity before base durability is stable
- Avoid stacking hill-strength exposures with other hard sessions
- Preserve one longer aerobic session per week if athlete tolerates it

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- Base must be genuinely low intensity; avoid “moderate drift”
- Avoid compressing phases due to impatience (“skipping base”)
- Avoid late-phase overload (sharpness ≠ fatigue)

## Gating Rules
Use this philosophy only if:
- Athlete can maintain routine frequency for multiple weeks
- Athlete has time budget to support meaningful aerobic development

Avoid / downgrade if:
- Time-crunched athlete cannot build base volume (use time-crunched threshold or 80/20)
