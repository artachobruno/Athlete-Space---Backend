# Training Philosophy: Daniels (E/M/T/I/R Intensity Taxonomy)

## Philosophy ID
daniels

## Applicable Race Types
- 5K to Marathon (road)

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Data-driven athletes who respond well to structured intensity
- Athletes who benefit from clear session intent and pace discipline
- Intermediate runners building toward repeatable quality work

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Aerobic base development (E)
- Lactate-threshold development (T)
- VO2max development (I)
- Neuromuscular economy/speed (R)
- Race-specific economy (M for marathon-focused cycles)

## Core Principles
- Each quality session has a single primary physiological intent
- Most training remains easy/aerobic; quality is limited and controlled
- Pace discipline reduces overreaching and improves repeatability
- Quality sessions are spaced with recovery buffers

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic (E): 70–85%
- Threshold (T): 5–15%
- VO2/Interval (I): 0–10%
- Repetition (R): 0–5%
- Marathon pace (M): 0–15% (only in marathon-specific phases)

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 2
- Hard days must be separated by at least 1 easy/rest day
- Long run is typically aerobic-focused (may include controlled sub-intensity segments only if athlete is durable)

## Sequencing Rules
- Do not schedule I and T in the same day
- Do not stack R after I without recovery buffering
- Keep “easy days” truly easy to preserve quality intent

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- Avoid mixing multiple intensity goals in a single session
- Avoid increasing intensity density while also increasing weekly volume
- Avoid “race every workout” behavior (pace creep)

## Gating Rules
Use this philosophy only if:
- Athlete can complete easy volume consistently without frequent breakdowns
- Athlete tolerates at least 1 quality day/week without lingering fatigue

Avoid / downgrade if:
- Athlete is novice, injury-prone, or lacks consistency (use durability-first or 80/20 first)
