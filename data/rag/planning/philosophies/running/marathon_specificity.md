# Training Philosophy: Marathon Specificity-First (Late-Cycle)

## Philosophy ID
marathon_specificity

## Applicable Race Types
- Marathon (late build and peak window)

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Marathon-focused athletes who already have a base
- Athletes preparing for a near-term marathon performance window
- Athletes who tolerate controlled marathon-specific stress

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Marathon-pace economy
- Fatigue resistance at marathon-specific intensity
- Psychological confidence through specificity (non-prescriptive)

## Core Principles
- Specificity is layered after base; it is not a replacement for it
- Marathon-specific intensity is controlled and repeatable
- Recovery is protected because specificity carries high residual fatigue risk

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 70–85%
- Marathon-specific: 5–20% (only in late cycle)
- Threshold/other: 0–10% (kept conservative)
- High intensity: 0–5% (rare; depends on athlete)

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 2
- Marathon-specific work counts as a hard day (budget accordingly)
- Reduce other intensity types while marathon-specific load increases

## Sequencing Rules
- Do not stack marathon-specific days without recovery buffering
- Keep easy days easy to preserve specificity execution
- Insert recovery week if fatigue accumulates

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- Avoid adding marathon-specific work while also ramping weekly volume sharply
- Avoid replacing recovery with more specificity
- Avoid late-cycle novelty (new stressors, new intensity types)

## Gating Rules
Use only if:
- Athlete has stable base and recent consistent training
- Athlete can recover from marathon-specific stress without breakdown

Avoid / downgrade if:
- Athlete is inconsistent, injury-prone, or lacks base (use durability-first / 80/20 first)
