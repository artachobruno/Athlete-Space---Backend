# Training Philosophy: Threshold-Heavy / Time-Crunched Running

## Philosophy ID
threshold_heavy

## Applicable Race Types
- 5K to Half marathon (primary)
- Marathon (secondary, only with strong durability)

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Experienced athletes with limited weekly time
- Athletes with stable durability and good recovery capacity
- Athletes who do not tolerate high volume but tolerate controlled threshold

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Improve performance efficiently via threshold development
- Maintain aerobic base with limited time
- Controlled intensity exposure to maximize stimulus per hour

## Core Principles
- Threshold is used as a “high return” stimulus when time is constrained
- Easy volume still exists as a foundation (even if smaller)
- Hard sessions are tightly capped to avoid overtraining

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 55–75%
- Threshold/tempo: 15–30%
- High intensity: 0–10%

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 2
- Mandatory easy buffers around threshold work
- Avoid combining threshold density with rapid volume increases

## Sequencing Rules
- Threshold days must be followed by easy/rest days
- High intensity (VO2/speed) is optional and cannot be added on top of high threshold density
- Do not allow “moderate intensity” to spread across the week

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- This approach has higher injury/fatigue risk if misapplied
- Avoid using threshold as a replacement for all training
- If fatigue rises, reduce threshold minutes first

## Gating Rules
Use this philosophy only if:
- Athlete has demonstrated durability under structured work
- Athlete can keep easy days truly easy

Avoid / downgrade if:
- Athlete is novice, inconsistent, or injury-prone (use 80/20 or durability-first)
