# Training Philosophy: Koop-Style Ultrarunning Principles

## Philosophy ID
koop

## Applicable Race Types
- Ultra running (road/trail), marathon-to-ultra transitions

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Athletes transitioning from marathon to ultra
- Trail-focused runners emphasizing durability and time-on-feet
- Athletes aiming for long-duration performance and resilience

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Durability and fatigue resistance for long durations
- Musculoskeletal resilience to extended load
- Event-specific preparedness (terrain/time demands)

## Core Principles
- Ultra success is primarily durability + pacing discipline + resilience
- Specificity increases as event approaches (terrain, duration patterns)
- Training stress must be managed conservatively due to high tissue load

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 80–95%
- Moderate/steady: 5–15%
- High intensity: 0–5% (optional, carefully managed)

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 1–2 (often 1 for high time-on-feet blocks)
- Back-to-back long stress days are advanced-gated and not default
- Recovery weeks are mandatory during long build cycles

## Sequencing Rules
- Do not stack intensity on top of high-duration blocks
- If terrain increases eccentric load (downhill), reduce other stressors
- Maintain consistency; avoid “big weekend” spikes unless explicitly gated

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- Injury risk rises sharply with rapid duration increases
- Avoid aggressive intensity while increasing long-run duration
- Avoid novelty late-cycle (new terrain/shoes/surfaces)

## Gating Rules
Use only if:
- Athlete has stable base mileage/frequency
- Athlete can recover from long sessions without lingering breakdown

Default downgrade:
- If athlete is injury-prone → durability-first ultra variant
