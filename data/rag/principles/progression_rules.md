# Principle: Progression Rules

## Description
Progression governs how training stress increases over time. The objective is to improve fitness while avoiding excessive fatigue accumulation and injury risk. Progression must be **gradual, recoverable, and reversible**.

This document defines progression as **constraints and decision rules**, not prescriptions.

## Training Stress Dimensions
Progression can increase any of the following:
1. **Volume** (total time/distance)
2. **Frequency** (sessions per week)
3. **Intensity density** (hard minutes or hard session count)
4. **Long-session stress** (long run/ride/swim duration)
5. **Complexity** (multi-modality, compound demands, technical stress)
6. **Specificity** (race-pace or event-like demands)

## Global Progression Guardrails
- Avoid increasing more than **one major stress dimension** at a time
- Insert recovery/deload weeks during sustained builds
- Prefer small, consistent increases over sporadic spikes
- Progression must be reversible if fatigue or pain signals rise

## Conservative Default Progression Pattern
When athlete readiness is uncertain:
- Increase volume gradually
- Keep intensity stable
- Add intensity only after a stable base is established

## Recovery Week Rules
A recovery week is required when:
- load has risen for multiple consecutive weeks
- fatigue signals show accumulation
- training monotony is high
- athlete is returning from illness/travel disruption

During a recovery week:
- reduce overall stress (typically via volume)
- maintain routine frequency where possible
- keep intensity exposure minimal and familiar (if any)

## Do-Not-Do Rules (Unsafe Patterns)
- Sudden large jumps in weekly volume
- Adding intensity at the same time as a volume ramp
- Increasing long-session duration while adding a new intensity type
- “Catch-up weeks” after missed sessions
- Eliminating recovery weeks in multi-week builds

## Sequencing Rules
- New intensity types require a stabilization period before progressing
- Long-session progression must be buffered with lower-stress days
- After a peak stress week, insert a lower-stress week

## Advancement Gating
More aggressive progression is allowed only if:
- athlete has consistent training history
- recent weeks show stable completion and recovery
- no recurring pain or breakdown patterns
- sleep/recovery behaviors are adequate (if known)

If gating criteria are not met:
- use conservative progression (or hold steady)
- prioritize consistency over progression

## Planner Decision Rules
When deciding whether to progress next week:
- If athlete completed sessions and recovery appears stable → progress one dimension slightly
- If athlete struggled or fatigue increased → hold or reduce load
- If pain signals appear → reduce stress and simplify structure

## Conservative Defaults (Planner)
If data is limited:
- choose “hold steady” over progression
- prefer low-intensity volume
- cap hard sessions at 1–2/week (often 1 if fatigue risk is elevated)
