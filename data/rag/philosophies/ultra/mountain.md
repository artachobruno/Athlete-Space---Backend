# Training Philosophy: Mountain / Uphill Economy Doctrine

## Philosophy ID
mountain

## Applicable Race Types
- Trail and mountain races, ultras with significant elevation

## Best-Fit Athlete Archetypes
- Trail/mountain athletes
- Athletes preparing for hilly courses
- Athletes with adequate baseline durability and strength tolerance

## Primary Adaptation Targets
- Uphill economy and sustainable output
- Muscular endurance for climbs
- Downhill resilience (eccentric tolerance) managed carefully

## Core Principles
- Vertical changes the stress profile; pace-based road logic is insufficient
- Uphill work emphasizes economy and durability over peak speed
- Downhill stress is a risk multiplier; exposure must be conservative

## Intensity Distribution (Typical Ranges)
- Easy/Aerobic: 80–95%
- Moderate/steady: 5–15%
- High intensity: 0–5% (optional, course-dependent)

## Weekly Structure Constraints
- Max hard days per week: 1–2
- Downhill-heavy sessions must be limited and buffered
- Avoid adding vertical stress while also adding intensity density

## Sequencing Rules
- Never stack downhill-heavy stress on consecutive days
- Place vertical stress away from other quality sessions
- Insert recovery after high eccentric exposure

## Guardrails and Anti-Patterns
- Too much downhill too soon causes tissue breakdown
- Avoid “hero vert weeks” with sudden jumps
- Avoid late-cycle novelty (new trails/shoes)

## Gating Rules
Use only if:
- Athlete has baseline durability and stable weekly training rhythm
- Athlete can handle gradual increases in eccentric load
